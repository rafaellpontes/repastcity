# Where do they burgle now? #

Using a GIS, it is possible to save the burglary results produced before and after the road closures and produce maps. The image below shows an example of this, using the Kernel Density Algorithm to generate density maps of the burglary rates. As we can see, once the agents have to start taking a different route to work the patterns of burglary change dramatically. Although we could have predicted some of the changes, there are others that are much less intuitive.

Hopefully this result has has demonstrated some of the benefits of this type of modelling. Even with an extremely simple model we have been able to generate some interesting, real world patterns that could not have been entirely predicted through our intuition alone.
